Gonna try some cool stuff with ng2



Angular 2 boilerplate project: A pristine Angularific front-end "skeleton" for your app. Build your own custom Classes, Services, Components and APIs on top.

All boilerplate code should be taken from this example, which is based on Getting Started with Angular 2.

Instructions

Have Node, NPM, TypeScript and Webpack installed and up-to-date on your laptop ~ AND ~ have the Angular, JavaScript Support, and Node plugins installed/activated in PhpStorm. Ok? Let's get rolling!

Create a new GitHub repository for your project. Add the .gitignore (boilerplate), clone, and create a new deployment!
Add package.json (boilerplate), and update the relevant fields for YOUR project.
Open Terminal or Git BASH. cd into your project root directory and run npm install on your laptop (hereafter referred to as "locally") AND on bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu (henceforth referred to as "remote")
Add tsconfig.json (boilerplate)

Add .bootstraprc (boilerplate)

Create the /webpack directory in the project root, and now we'll create all your webpack files!

Create helpers.js (boilerplate)
Create webpack.common.js (boilerplate)
Create webpack.live.js (boilerplate)
Create index.php - This is your Webpack HTML template. Webpack will build your main app page based on this template. Update the custom tag here with your app name. We'll reference this later in Angular.
Create the /app directory, and we'll add all your app files here.

Create app/vendor.ts (boilerplate). Select OK to TypeScript compiling in PhpStorm.
Create app/polyfills.ts (boilerplate)
Create app/app.css You can leave this blank for now. All your custom CSS will be written here.
Create app/app.ts (boilerplate)
Create app/app.module.ts - Mostly boilerplate code, but you'll need to update this later on. You'll need to reference your Services here in the future.
Create app/app.component.ts - Update the selector here with your app name. The custom tag you previously set inside your webpack/index.php file needs to MATCH here. Update the templateUrl filename to be "yourappname-app.php". We'll create and update this file later.
Create app/app.routes.ts - Update these routes for YOUR app. Since we only have a Home Page View for now, the only Component we need is HomeComponent. You will need to update this file for any additional Views you create later.
Create the app/components directory and create your app Components here.

Create home-component.ts The sample code here is BARE BONES. Customize as needed.
NOTE: All your TypeScript "transpiling" should now resolve! ~~
Create your /public_html/templates directory

Create your base template HTML: yourapp-app.php
Create your splash/home template HTML: home.php
add the .htaccess file to /public_html - boilerplate code

Run npm run build both locally and remote and you should be good to go!
